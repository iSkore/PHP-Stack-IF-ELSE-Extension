# PHP-Stack IF ELSE Extension

Program in PHP with RapidWeaver Stacks? Us this stack in combination with [PHP-Stack](https://github.com/iSkore/PHP-Stack) to fix a few of the PHP problems prevalent throughout Stacks and Stacks plugins. Drag and drop other stacks right into the PHP IF ELSE Extension and use the power of PHP without the hassle.

Add this to your Stack page to use PHP if and else if statements without the hassle of encasing a stack within two HTML stacks. Using PHP within an HTML stack "works" but has some pretty bad issues that occur when doing open ended PHP statements.

Put in your if ( ) and else if ( ) statement right in the UI side bar. Common uses for user login information, form submitting, sending emails, showing and hiding other stacks, etc.
